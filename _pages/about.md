<span style="color:black; font-family:Georgia">Greetings!üññüèª</span>

<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia">I am a recent graduate from the Department of CSE, 
<a href="https://aust.edu/">Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology</a>. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and 
Engineering from the same university. My career aspiration is to become a scientist and work in leading AI research laboratories. 
I am particularly interested in working on NLP and Vision works. </p>


<p style="text-align:justify;color:black; font-family:Georgia">
Ever since I was a child, I've been incredibly curious, and that curiosity has driven me to want to become a researcher. While studying Computer Science and Engineering, I completed various projects for my coursework, and that experience made me even more passionate about doing excellent work.

As I got closer to graduation, I realized that my interest in research, especially in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), had grown immensely. I'm particularly drawn to areas like natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. My plan is to explore these subjects deeply and use what I learn to create user-friendly software for everyone to use.</p>
<!-- From my childhood, I have aspired to become a researcher as my curiosity knows no bounds. From my time in CSE, I have completed several projects related to my lab assignments. These projects has kept me driven to achieve excellence in my work. As graduation had approached I realised my curiosity for research had grown. As such, I chose to drive my passion towards artificial intelligence (AI). AI has always piqued my curiosity and field of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision has interested me most. I plan to dive deeper in the corresponding fields and as well as will try to apply them in software for general public to use. -->
